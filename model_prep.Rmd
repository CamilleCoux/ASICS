Let's apply the HMSC pipeline to CROZET.


```{r}
library(tidyr)
library(magrittr)
library(Hmsc)

# set directories
localDir = "."
dataDir = file.path(localDir, "../data")
modelDir = file.path(localDir, "models")
if(!dir.exists(modelDir)) dir.create(modelDir)


# for reproducibility
set.seed(1)

# read in species data



```






This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
